# Amey Bhavsar — Product Engineer · AI/ML

> Product engineer with 3 years building AI/ML systems from scratch — video intelligence pipelines, multimodal models, and production microservices. Currently at Tessact, building video repurposing systems and face detection services for enterprise clients like JioHotstar and SunTV.

## About

I'm a product engineer focused on shipping end-to-end AI systems. Most of what I've built is in production and handles real load — not demos. At Tessact, I've worked on:

- AI pipelines with LLM orchestration using PydanticAI and LangChain
- Video processing infrastructure handling 500+ hours of content
- Face tracking and detection systems replacing AWS Rekognition
- React frontends that customers use daily

Previously built Saathi, an AI mental health companion that achieved 95.51% accuracy on bipolar detection and placed 4th at IIT Bombay RESCON.

## Skills

- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, LLMs (GPT-4/5, Gemini 2.5), PydanticAI, LangChain, InsightFace, Whisper, CLIP
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Django, Celery, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Remotion
- **Cloud**: GCP (Cloud Run), AWS (Lambda), Docker, Kubernetes

## Projects

- [TessactAI — Video Repurposing](/work/tessact-video-repurposing): Built solo in 2 months. Takes 2-hour podcasts and produces 30–40 branded social clips. Processed 500+ hours for enterprise POCs.
- [Face Detection & Tracking Service](/work/face-detection-tracking): Replaced AWS Rekognition. Cut cost from $6 to $0.15 per hour — saves $2,500/month. Production for JioHotstar and SunTV.
- [Saathi — AI Mental Health Companion](/work/saathi): CNN + LSTM system trained on 100k+ Reddit posts. 4th at IIT Bombay RESCON. Published IEEE.
