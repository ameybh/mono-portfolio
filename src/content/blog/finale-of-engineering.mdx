## Starting an internship

Joined [Tessact](https://tessact.com/) as SDE1 Intern two weeks back. Migrated the bundling stack to Vite from create-react-app and explored the code base completing a few tasks. React code without Redux seems really clean 😆

## Taste of placements

A few companies are expected to arrive in upcoming months. Took the first round for one and absolutely nailed it. Wonder how long until it gets challenging. Tessact might be giving me direct job offer and it seems very attractive than anything that shall come to college.
