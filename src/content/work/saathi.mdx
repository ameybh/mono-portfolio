## Problem

The thesis started from a frustration I couldn't shake: getting actual mental health support is slow, expensive, and hard to access. For my final year, I wanted to see how close you could get to something useful using NLP — specifically around detecting bipolar disorder signals from text.

The question was whether a conversational system could identify those signals accurately enough to be worth building.

## Approach

### Sentiment & mood detection

Trained a **CNN + LSTM hybrid** on over 100,000 Reddit posts from mental health communities (r/bipolar, r/depression, r/mentalhealth). The CNN layer extracts local textual features (word patterns, n-gram signals); the LSTM layer captures long-range sequential dependencies in how mood states evolve across a conversation.

Multi-class classification across: euthymia, hypomanic, manic, depressive, and mixed states.

### Conversational interface

**RASA** handles dialogue management — intent classification, entity extraction, and conversation state. The sentiment model runs as a custom RASA component, feeding mood state predictions into the dialogue policy.

Response strategies vary based on detected state: de-escalation for manic states, validation and gentle activation for depressive states, psychoeducation during euthymia.

### Dataset

- **r/bipolar**, **r/depression**, **r/mentalhealth** posts (2018–2022)
- Labels derived from post flair and manual annotation for a validation subset
- Preprocessing: tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, slang normalization

## Tech Stack

- **ML**: TensorFlow (CNN + LSTM), custom preprocessing pipeline
- **NLP**: RASA (dialogue management), NLTK, spaCy
- **Backend**: Python, Flask API
- **Deployment**: Local + university server

## Results

- **95.51% accuracy** on bipolar disorder detection (held-out test set)
- **4th place at IIT Bombay RESCON** — national-level research competition
- **Published IEEE 2023** — peer-reviewed conference paper
- System demonstrated live to faculty evaluation panel

## What I learned

This was my first real NLP project at any scale. The biggest challenge was label quality: Reddit post flair is noisy, and a model trained on noisy labels learns the noise. We added a secondary annotation pass using a small crowd-sourced validation set — carefully labelled — which helped calibration a lot.

RASA's dialogue management is powerful but opinionated. Integrating a custom PyTorch/TF component required wrapping it as a RASA custom component — good architectural lesson in interface design.

The accuracy numbers are promising, but I'm careful about overstating what this means clinically. A detection model is a screening signal, not a diagnosis — and the thesis was careful to frame it that way.
